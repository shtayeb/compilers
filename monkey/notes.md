## Parser
A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds
a data structure(tree) and checks for correct syntax in the process.

Parsing is also called syntactic analysis.

### Prsing Strategies
- top-down parsing(starts by contructing the root node then descends)
    - Recursive descent parsing
    - Early parsing
    - Predictive parsing
- bottom-up parsing(start by contructing leaf nodes then ascends)
